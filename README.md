# portfolio-2

This project we were tasked with completeing a functional portfolio of our work completed in the course thus far. This included 2 homework assignments, our current group porject, contact info, and an about me.
# Installation

I utilized my homework 2 as the starting point of the project. The remainder of the formatting was from Boot Strap. 

# Usage
I can use this portfolio as a reference when applying for jobs. I will also improve on this in portfolio 2 and 3. I hope to improve the formatting.
