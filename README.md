# portfolio-2

This project we were tasked with completeing a functional portfolio of our work completed in the course thus far. This included projects 1 and 2 as well as a homework assignment. I also updated the background of the portfolio and added some additional skills learned. 
# Installation

Utilized boot strap for CSS. The rest of the info was simply using index.html. 

# Usage
I can use this portfolio as a reference when applying for jobs. I will continue to add content as I complete them in my program/career/
